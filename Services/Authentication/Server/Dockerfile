# add glide.yaml and glide.lock
# as you can see that glide.yaml and glide.lock are being added separately (instead of doing a ADD . .),
#   resulting in separate layers. By separating out package management to a separate layer,
#   Docker will cache the layer and will only rebuild it if the corresponding files change,
#                           i.e. when a new package is added or an existing one is removed.
#   Hence, glide install wonâ€™t be executed for every source code change.
